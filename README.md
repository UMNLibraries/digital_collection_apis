# Digital Collection API Documentation

This documentation introduces researchers to some useful APIs to access and download resources from [UMedia](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/). UMedia provides open access to digitized materials from across the University of Minnesota. The objective of the documentation is to help researchers programmatically download items from UMedia to their local computer. The documentation has three parts: 

1. [Formatting URLs to download text and metadata \(JSON\)](./JSON/json_umedia.md) 
2. [Formatting URLs to download still images and other digital objects \(IIIF\)](./IIIF/construct_iiif_umedia.md) 
3. An [iPython notebook](https://github.com/UMNLibraries/digital_collection_apis/blob/master/API_Documentation.ipynb) to illustrate how to download texts and objects using the URLs formatted in the previous steps. This notebook introduces three useful Python modules: json, shutil, and requests. It also introduces data structures used to store digital objects and the basic export of content to your local machine.

Each section is accompanied by examples to help readers understand the contents. API documentation for UDC/DRUM is still being developed.
